Face Detection Access

This tool helps in the detection and recognition of familiar specified faces
using the LPBH (Local Patern Binary Histogram) in the detection and recognition

This still a work in progress which will be next added a GUI and more improvement 

My objective is to implement an application into the Raspberry Pi that can identify
and recognise different faces and decide whether to allow access or not

Prerequisites 

- Python 3
- OpenCv 3.3

Usage 

- First you need to execute the script Capture.py and enter a name and it will be saved 
- then execute the train.py script to train our model
- now you can run main.py and it will start detection and recognition
- finally if you wish to remove a person execute delete.py and specify the name
